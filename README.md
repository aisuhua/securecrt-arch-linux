# VanDyke SecureCRT PKGBUILD for Arch Linux

The AUR lacks a PKGBUILD for VanDyke SecureCRT. I've written a basic one. Provide your own license after the installation, otherwise it's a 30 day trial.

# Install

Clone the repo, cd in to it and:

    makepkg -si

Done.

## 安装

```sh
wget https://github.com/aisuhua/securecrt-arch-linux/blob/master/scrt-7.3.5.903.ubuntu13-64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf scrt-7.3.5.903.ubuntu13-64.tar.gz
cd scrt-7.3.5

wget http://download.boll.me/securecrt_linux_crack.pl
sudo perl securecrt_linux_crack.pl ./SecureCRT
```
